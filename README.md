# chart-zooming

Objectives:

- Make zooming look like [yahoo chart](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/AAPL/)
- y-axis should adapt to current visible data (min/max) during/after zoom
- Make chart ui smooth (scrolling through the x axis should have the same effect as zooming)
- Make legend text larger

Short said, please make the chart look professional and its handling smooth. 

If you find something else that can be improved, please fix this too. 
If you hit 5 hours worktime, please ask before proceeding.


Thank you Lam!
